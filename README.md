## Introduction

In this project of mine called Book-Lib, I made an intuitive and simple platform for the user to log their book details like its title, its author details, its number of pages as well as its reading status. With its elegant design it is for those book enthusiasts like me who like to read  books and keep track of the books they've read or they will read as well as the books they are currently reading right now. Its design is elegant and simple with a plus button to add books and beautiful cards which log their book information. Whether you are a passionate reader like me or just started reading as a beginner, "Book-Lib" is for you to keep track of your reading goals and broaden your horizons of amazing knowledge and imagination capabilities.

## Features

This is a very basic and simple project of mine so the features are simple as well which are listed as follows -:

- A '+' button to add books which enlarges when hovered and gives a nice and elegant animation when hovered and opens a form to log book details.
- A book form for the user to log his book details.
- A reading status feature for the user to log his said status of his book.
- Captivating animations for all the buttons.
- An add button for adding the book information.
- A cancel button if you change your mind.

## Learnings

This project like all my other projects taught me a great deal of many key concepts which are involved in javascript especially objects and object constructor such as using dot-notations to access the object values and we use objects for literally everything from its methods to it properties and I also learned a great deal about object constructor also learning how we can use various parameters for assigning object values and also learned about 'this' keyword and how to add the object directly to array using array method 'push' and 'this' keyword. I had already learned about DOM manipulation and event listeners in my previous projects. That is all about the key concepts I learned about in this project.
